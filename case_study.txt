🎯 Before you start
🔎 What We're Assessing

This case study evaluates your ability to:
●​
●​
●​
●​

Work with real-world data and ambiguity
Deliver quality analytics solutions under time constraints
Use modern tools (including AI) effectively
Think critically about data quality and business logic

**Important**: We value your reasoning and problem-solving approach over
"perfect" answers. There are often multiple valid solutions - what matters is that
you can justify your choices.

🤖 AI Usage Policy

AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) are encouraged - use them as you
would in your daily work. We evaluate your effectiveness and critical thinking.
This test is designed to be completed in 1h to 1h30 with AI assistance. Take your
time to ensure quality.

🏆 Tips for Success
On Assumptions

●​ Make assumptions when facing ambiguity - this reflects real-world work
●​ Explain your reasoning clearly in your submission
●​ We're interested in how you handle uncertainty, not just final answers
On Scope
●​ You may not need to use every table mentioned
●​ Focus on answering the core questions well
●​ Quality over comprehensiveness

Part 1: Business Analysis [30 - 45 min]
Context
Gross Merchandise Value (GMV) is a critical metric for marketplaces,
representing the total value of goods sold. For example, if a marketplace sells
1,000 items at €100 each in a given period, the GMV would be €100,000.
The Customer Success team needs a dashboard to monitor marketplace
performance in 2024.
You have access to fact_order_line and fact_shop tables and the YAML file
documenting each table and their columns.

Questions
1.​ Using the available data, what do you think would be a good definition of
GMV and why? Explicitly state what you include/exclude and why?
2.​ Based on your definition : identify the top 5 best shops contributing the
most to the 2024 GMV for each marketplace. (Please join your results and
your SQL / code in your answer)

3.​ Calculate how many shops were active each month in 2024 and show the
month-over-month change (Please join your results and your SQL / code in
your answer)

4.​ Using the available data, suggest 3 additional KPIs that would be valuable
for the Customer Success dashboard. For each KPI, briefly state:
○​ KPI name and definition​
○​ Business value (what decision does it inform?)

Part 2: Data Modeling [20 - 30 min]
Context
Market+ is a marketplace platform connecting third-party sellers with
customers.
They work with sellers ranging from small local shops to large distributors,
offering products across many categories and geographic regions leading to a
large amount of orders

Order Process Flow
1.​ Product Listing: Sellers publish products associated with one or more
categories. (e.g. “Electronics,” “Home & Decor,” “Fashion,” etc.).
2.​ Orders: Customers order products, creating order items for each
purchased product.
3.​ Payment: Customer can choose from different payment methods; Every
payment information and their related status are recorded
4.​ Shipping: Order handed to a carrier (or more than one if the order
contains items from different sellers) for delivery
5.​ Commission: Marketplace charges commission per transaction on the
total order amount or specific products
6.​ Reviews: Customers can review products/sellers after delivery

⚠️ Business Rules
●​ A seller can offer multiple products
●​ Orders can have **multiple carriers** (items from different sellers)
●​ Order total amount includes the sum of the prices of the ordered products
plus any shipping fees and taxes.
●​ Categories are hierarchical (parent-child relationships)

Task: Design a STAR Schema
You need to model the data to support analytics on Market+'s sales and
performance by implementing a star schema.
Your model should be able to provide answers to the following business
questions:
1.​ What is the revenue generated by category and by seller for a given
month?
2.​ What is the order volume and total billed amount by region and/or
customer country?
3.​ How do the marketplace’s collected commissions evolve over time?
4.​ Which payment methods are most used, and what impact do they have on
approval or rejection rates?

5/6

Guideline questions
●​ Which fact table(s) do you need? What grain?
●​ Which dimensions should you extract from existing tables?
●​ Which metrics (measures) would you store in the fact table?

Deliverable

⚠️ You do not need to calculate the answers to the questions above - just design
a model that would enable the analysis.

1.​ Create a STAR schema diagram using dbdiagram.io
2.​ Written Summary to address these points
1.​ Your choice, trade-offs or assumptions
2.​ Potential Modeling Challenges
